{0: ['True Enslavement?', 'Saturday, January 06, 2018', "Many people in the 21st century who aren't Christian think that to be serving a God wholeheartedly and to be a Christian is being enslaved into a system of controlling pastors and pressure from others to be \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99. They think by not being religious, they are free. But looking back, they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. To be enslaved actually gives some freedom.<br /><br/><br />In America, there are several laws that all citizens must follow. Just think of the laws that put murders in jail or even gives them the death penalty. Do many people see this law as something that they are a slave to? Not really. This grants them freedom to live and not fear that they can be killed. Granted, there are people who disobey laws, but for the most part, these laws will keep people in line.<br /><br/><br />In Christianity, it works likewise. The closer you build a relationship to the Lord, the more you think in line with his thoughts. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where it feels like the world is trying to squeeze the life out of you, we know that we can trust in the Lord and we will come out better than we went in.<br /><br/><br />But the thing is, you have to give up your rights. The Lord sets boundaries to what he wants us to do. We give up the rights to murder, and we are protected from murder. With the Lord, we give up our own desires that go against the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s character, and you can go to the moon and back all with the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s help.<br /><br/><br />\xe2\x80\x9c34 Jesus replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin. 35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.\xe2\x80\x9d John 8:34-36 NLT<br /><br/><br />In this scripture, when you\xe2\x80\x99re adopted into God\xe2\x80\x99s house, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a slave. You are free. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a slave to worry, because God has your life in his hands. Even if you are faced with death and it comes, you know that you will go to eternity with the Lord. As my pastor\xe2\x80\x99s famous quote goes: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can never threaten a Christian with Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d<br /><br/><br />I hope this encourages you to realize that to become a Christian, you are free from everything that can hold you down in life, because you are a child of God, and God is for you, and would never want to see you fall."], 1: ['First Love', 'Wednesday, January 17, 2018', 'My mom watches a lot of movies on the Hallmark Channel, and whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m in the living room with her, \xe2\x80\x98love\xe2\x80\x99 is a common thing I hear. As for me, being a computer whiz (like seriously, this website was made from blank files and folders, coded by me), and a Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube hobbyist, romance isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to come by. As a teenager in a public school, romance is half of what I hear about. To be honest, if I cleared out some of the knowledge of who is dating who, maybe I could finally pick up C++. Anyways, romance for me isn\xe2\x80\x99t something I would call myself an expert with.<br /><br><br />But I can say this: when you first fall in love with someone, is it some boring experience? How often do people just say \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, guess I\xe2\x80\x99m in love again.\xe2\x80\x9d? Normally, that person is someone you cannot get off your mind. Every time they show up, they seem like the center of the universe. For most Christians, they have a similar experience when they first fall in love with Christ. All you want to do is to cry out in worship for how amazing He is, and how He has redeemed you, and all He has done for you.<br /><br><br />But in some marriages, it may seem like all love at first, but after a while, that seems to fade away. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me? Google \xe2\x80\x98global divorce rate\xe2\x80\x99. The United States it at a shocking 53%, while other countries around the world are even higher. People get high on that \xe2\x80\x98love at first sight\xe2\x80\x99 feeling, and when they realize that it takes time and effort to make an effective marriage, they decide to call it off. I even know a few people in my everyday life that are like that.<br /><br><br />In the Bible, there are many references to the church being the bride of Christ. In Revelation 19:7-9, it says that people who are invited to the wedding feast are blessed. Marriage is definitely a God inspired idea, because it all starts with our relationship with Him.<br /><br><br />But in this marriage, there are times where it isn\xe2\x80\x99t always right. And many times, people fall away from God because they blame this on Him. If you think it over, you\xe2\x80\x99re blaming what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in your life on the God who you just believed saved you? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t very logical, because God is perfect, and any misfortunes can\xe2\x80\x99t come from Him. Sometimes, things go on in life. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t God\xe2\x80\x99s fault.<br /><br><br />Recently in life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going through some rough times. Between school, home life, and just generally life, my head has been spinning in ways I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to. But, this I know: because I am a believer in the one and only Jesus Christ, my life is in His hands, so I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to worry about. But how much do I believe that? Or more, how do my actions reflect that I believe that? Do I speak in a way that reflects that? Am I really in love with Christ, or am I merely going through the motions? What about what happened at the alter at summer camp?<br /><br><br />What I need to do is return to my first love. I need to drop everything and return to the point where I was so passionate for Christ, that all I could give was worship. As the Disciple song titled \xe2\x80\x98First Love\xe2\x80\x99 says, I need to give up everything that I am and surrender myself to the Lord.<br /><br><br />\xe2\x80\x9cTake me back, to the moment that we were so close, that our hearts would beat as one.\xe2\x80\x9d -Disciple, First Love<br /><br><br />If you are in a place where you think you\xe2\x80\x99re drowning in an ocean of life, just return to how it first was. Go back to where you once believed and give up everything in worship to the Lord.<br /><br><br />As for me, just keep me in your prayers that I will learn this lesson of what I\xe2\x80\x99m writing, and can return to that place where all I know is God.'], 2: ['Dead Militia (song by Disciple)', 'Monday, February 05, 2018', "I will say right out, if you don't know that I am a huge fan of Christian Rock, then you obviously don't know me too well. I will admit, I am quite a music addict. Just something about music flowing makes me happy. But today, I was listening to my Christian Rock playlist (message me if you want the Spotify link), and I suddenly felt the urge to listen to one of my favorite songs, Dead Militia. Of course, once the song I was listening to was over, I got right into that song. Midway through the song, I finally realized it's meaning.<br /><br />Earlier in the day, I was watching videos by a YouTube channel called The Bible Project, and I watched their videos about Revalations. The video talked all about the saints and the martyrs and how the seals were to be opened, and everything in Revalations.<br /><br />When I was listening to the song, it then hit me what the meaning of the song was. Dead Militia. The martyrs were asking to get revenge on the evil that killed them, but God told them to wait (Revalation 6:10-11). This was dead, who died in Christ's name, and also the army that wanted to avenge the evil, which is the milita part. The rest of the song contains references to Revalations, and honestly gives the song a deeper meaning than what I thought it was before.<br /><br />Definitely check out The Bible Project on YouTube, and Disciple's song Dead Militia on YouTube, Spotify, or whatever else you use to listen to music."], 3: ['To You I Will Adhere', 'Monday, February 12, 2018', "In English, we had to write poems. I think I am a fan of poetry, just because they are designed to flow and have meaning like music. But one of the requirements for this assignment was to have a spiritualness to the poem, so I decided to go literal and make it about a Christian who is having issues in life, but is trusting in the Lord for help. Here it is:<br /></br><br />Trying to hide<br />All the things I cry<br />About; the fear,<br />And the hurt inside.<br /><br/><br />I feel death coming near,<br />And it feels quite clear.<br />Maybe if I might,<br />To You I will adhere.<br /><br/><br />And with You I can take flight,<br />Because You are the light!<br />You guide my way,<br />All the way through the night.<br /><br/><br />And to You I pray,<br />Do not let me sway,<br />And even when I don't obey,<br />To me, You will not betray."], 4: ['In You, I Find Rest', 'Monday, February 12, 2018', 'So I decided to write another poem.

I highly doubt that in our little town, something like this would happen, but then again, we\'ve been in the news for drugs and other stuff like that. <br /><br />But as I was listening to everyone talk about it, it inspired me to write another poem, saying that we should praise God, even in our hardships.

One of them, Habakkuk, interested me. The beginning seemed to resemble how Christians may think in modern America.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\x9cHow long, O Lord, must I call for help? But you do not listen! 'Violence is everywhere!' I cry, but you do not come to save. Must I forever see these evil deeds? Why must I watch all this misery? Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight. The law has become paralyzed, and there is no justice in the courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, so that justice has become perverted.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />Habakkuk 1:2-4 NLT<br /><br />It seems like moral is unacceptable and immortal is acceptable. Law is perverted, and the courts approve it. Many may think that even as we pray for our schools, they still have shootings that become worse everyday. I've gotten to the point that I've been desensitized to it, and another shooting is just another shooting. That's the state of the country.<br /><br />Unlike in Habakkuk, we may not have another nation come in and take over, but we still are in a stituation where the nation isn't right. Habakkuk then asked God about why he would use another nation that is more irreverent to God to conquer Isreal. But then He says how they will have their downfall too because of their immorality.<br /><br />This reminds me of the story of Job, where he deals with 'punishment', even though he was rightous in God's eyes (Job 2:3). But, insead, this is a judgement of character, and to see how Job reacts and weather he is still reverent to God. In the end, Job humbles himself before God, and shows his reverence, and is rewarded with twice of what he had before his trials came.<br /><br />So even though that we may not see a nation come and take America over, but it shows that even while we deal with trials and stay reverent to God, we will be reawrded in the end."], 7: ['Circus for a Psycho', 'Saturday, March 24, 2018', 'I have a really quick post, which interprets a part of a song. For a while, I\'ve loved this song, but the meaning has been sort of confusing for me. This song is Circus for a Psycho, released by Skillet in their amazing 2013 album, Rise.<br /><br />This song describes what sounds like a circus, with crazy acts. But it also sounds like a battle, and some sort of attempt to be conquered, but overcoming it. I was listening to it while I was writing down thoughts for a video game concept that I\'ve had for a few years now, and I noticed a certain line which says: "Got your finger on the trigger / You think that you\xe2\x80\x99re the winner / You\xe2\x80\x99re going to get kicked off of your throne". With Easter next week, it sort of reminded me of the story of Jesus\' death and resurrection. When the pharisees thought they were doing good and removing a blasphemous teacher from the scene, and securing their own piety and reverence. But the truth is (although the Jewish may disagree), they brought Jesus\' victory over death, and get Him His place on the throne next to the Lord.<br /><br />These three lines represent the whole story. "Got your finger on the trigger" shows how the pharisees were plotting to kill Jesus, and had their fingers on a weapon that would bring death. "You think that you\'re the winner" means that they think they\'ve won, and that they succeeded to kill someone who is a \'false prophet\' of God. Then "You\'re going to get kicked off of your throne" shows how Jesus comes back victorious, and will defeat evil and corruption, and in the end, he has the final word.<br /><br />Realizing this was a shocker, especially just watching videos about the Gospels. Also, this is a Biblical hint for any who were still suspicious about Skillet\'s religiousness as a band. If there are any more scripture references in this song, I will probably make future posts about them.<br />'], 8: ['Still', 'Thursday, April 19, 2018', 'If you\'ve ever been out in nature, you would know that water is a very valuable resource. Water can also be beautiful. But picture this: sitting on the bank of a lake, looking out onto the peaceful water. But then think of a rushing river, with rapids creating a constant thrashing of water flowing downstream really fast. Vast difference, isn\'t it?<br /><br />Think of the story of Jesus, where he was on the boat and calmed the storm. "One day Jesus said to his disciples, \'Let\xe2\x80\x99s cross to the other side of the lake.\' So they got into a boat and started out. As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap. But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger. The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, \'Master, Master, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to drown!\' When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm. Then he asked them, \'Where is your faith?\' The disciples were terrified and amazed. \'Who is this man?\' they asked each other. \'When he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!\'" (Luke 8:22-25 NLT)<br /><br />In this, it didn\'t take a toll on Jesus to calm the storm, he just did it. When you think about life, between work, school, sports, social media, friends, family, and leisure time, it can feel like you\'re drowning in the river I mentioned earlier; drowning in appointments, activity, social judgment, traveling, working, and constantly being busy.<br /><br />But in Jesus\' name, we can have peace, and it can all be called to still.<br /><br />The other day, I listened to the song <a href="https://genius.com/Hillsong-worship-still-lyrics">\'Still\' by Hillsong</a>, and the chorus goes like this:<br />When the oceans rise and thunders roar<br />I will soar with You above the storm<br />Father, You are King over the flood<br />I will be still, know You are God<br /><br />The disciples acknowledged that Jesus was the person who could save them, and that\'s when the storm was calmed. We aren\'t called to be caught up in the storm, but we are called to be different, and stand out and stand still, knowing that Jesus is Lord. In this, people will see this how our faith, and will be a demonstration that God is Lord above everything.<br /><br />This lesson is definitely something I need to learn, but I hope everyone can learn from this. Hope you enjoyed!'], 9: ['Spirital Warfare', 'Monday, April 23, 2018', 'Last night, I was writing down some things in my notebook (that I haven\'t touched in a while now), and I didn\'t think about it at the time, but I basically signed myself into spiritual warfare.<br /><br />I used part of the Diciple song \'Game On\':<br />"When the lights go up and the game is on<br />    Are you ready for me?<br />    \'Cause I\'m ready for you.<br />When the bell rings out this fight is on<br />    Are you ready for me?<br />    \'Cause I\'m ready for you!"<br /><br />Also, to close out what I wrote, I said "Get to your knees, get ready to bow.". If that isn\'t signing up for a spiritual warfare, I don\'t know what is.<br /><br />Today, I had a test I wasn\'t prepared for. Normally, I am never feel ready for tests in this subject (because I struggle with it), but today, I <i>wasn\'t</i> ready. As per usual, I prayed over the test, asked for wisdom dispite me struggling. (Now that I think about it, I normally pray over the whole class, but I forgot to do so this time. Whoops.) But as I went on and continued to star the questions I had no idea on, I got more frustrated, and by time I handed in the test, I was starting to be in tears. During the test, all I could think of was how I am slow, how I can\'t handle all my assignments, how I push it off as me not focusing but it probably is just me being lazy and procrastinating, and all these thoughts of worthlessness. It literally ruined my day.<br /><br />Satan doesn\'t want us to be happy in the Lord. We will do whatever he can to break us down so low that we won\'t let God reach us. Today, he tried to pull me there. But tonight, I took this all in, and I realized that I was actually under attack. My innocent writing of being ready for attack actually brought me to being attacked.<br /><br />Also, yesterday during worship at church, our amazing worship leader sang a new song (although I spent a minute trying to remember if we sang it at one of our youth worship services) called \'New Wine\'by Hillsong. In the bridge, there are two lines:<br />"I lay down my old flames<br />To carry Your new fire today."<br />And when we sang these lines, I felt like I was physically holding a torch. I have no other explanation other than God working. If I had to give any interpretation, it would be either that I would carry the light of this torch into battle, like in the story of Gideon (Judges 7:20), they held torches and the LORD lead them victorious through battle. I might be wrong, but that\'s honestly how I felt holding this invisible torch.<br /><br />This is only the start of this. War on the enemy is declared, so he better square up, because the heat\'s about to get on.<br /><br />"You wanna try to take me under<br /> I\'ll never bow till I\'m six feet under<br /> Listen to the sound of rolling thunder<br /> You can\'t break me<br /> You\'ll never take me down"<br />-Thousand Foot Krutch ~ Down'], 10: ['Blessed', 'Sunday, April 29, 2018', "We are blessed as Christians to be able to go to church every Sunday and worship God Almighty. We are blessed to serve a God who is looking out for our best interests, and not just a god who wants praise for their own glory.<br /><br />As Christians, we believe in Jesus, who sacrificed his life for us. We believe and worship not because we have to, but because we want to.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\x9cWe love each other because he loved us first.\xe2\x80\x9d 1 John 4:19 NLT<br /><br />It's an honor to worship God, who first loved us, and didn't expect us to love Him first before he loved us."], 11: ['Constant', 'Monday, May 28, 2018', 'I wrote a poem. Again. This poem I got during a Sunday worship. I just suddenly had the idea of the Lord being constant. He is the rock that we can stand on and can be assured that it will never move. You can rely on science, but the Word has always been there. You stand on trends, but you never know what the next fidget spinner could be. You could rely on relationships, but unless it is a relationship with God at the center (then you\'re standing on the rock anyways), you\'re not going to get anywhere. Some people might argue about the last one, but I\'d want to provide my proof. My proof is in the 50% or more divorce rate, abortions, homosexual relationships, and other stuff. The idea of a mother-father-children family has gotten so perverted my the country taking God\'s ideas into our own control. But when you fall back on the Lord, it\'s all designed to be perfect. The Lord is constant. That\'s what this poem is about. Some people thought it sounded like a song, but I didn\'t write it to be put to music.

Here they are:<br /><ol><br /><li>I plan to be switching my current system of writing/publishing posts. The website will stay the same, and theoretically there should be no noticable difference for the reader. Here's a technical explanation: I currently use Python to write to files and convert them to HTML for the website and they get uploaded to GitHub in the public repository that everyone can see. While I programmed everything and I am proud of it, there are several things that I might still need to do (like saving posts when you're done so you don't have to rewrite them), but I have a better way now that I am going to do this. While I could migrate over to Wordpress, I don't want to. I like complete control over my website. What I will be doing is moving all my data over to Google Firebase, which is a live updating database system that works with JavaScript and web stuff. And migrating to Firebase leads into my second annoucement:</li><br /><li>I will be making an effort to have multiple authors on the website. I know several members of my youth group write stuff down, and since I am gifted with the technical knowledge that I have, I might as well not keep it all for myself and share it to make something that we can all use. I will be rebranding a little bit, and call it BibleThoughts instead of just Teen Bible Thoughts. Why? I honestly don't know. I think it's more because I'm getting older, so I want to still be a part of it and keep this alive, but I might as well rebrand now while I'm making these changes. But multiple authors. It's something I've wanted to do for a while, but now I have all the tools to do it. Now just to do it...</li><br /><li>My final announcement will be good for those who view my page on their phone. I do know that this site isn't very mobile friendly, and that's why I want to make a mobile friendly version, and also make it so that you can add it as an app on your phone to view at any time. It will still be a website, which has it's limitations as a website, but I already am working on it for iOS, and hopefully will figure it out for Android. I am working on this now, so this will probably be the first update to come out. I want to get this done so I can slot the Firebase changes right in for the new layout for mobile.</li></ol><br /><br />I am excited for these changes, and will probably get working on them when summer break starts (either when I am 'studying for finals', or when I am lying in bed in pain from getting my only 3 wisdom teeth removed. I already know most of what needs to be done, but I just need to do it. I'm excited!!!"], 13: ["God's Presence", 'Wednesday, July 11, 2018', 'I actually shouldn\'t be on my laptop right now, but I was watching a sermon on the Hillsong Channel, and it made me think of this post, so I think my mom can excuse it this time.<br /><br />Anyways, I was watching a sermon on the Hillsong Channel because it was on and it gave me a reason to stay up. I wasn\'t paying too much attention to the main topic of the sermon, but when I payed attention, the preacher was talking about entering the presence of God. He said that there were three ways to enter into the presense of God, and he said the first one was through worship. He gave a few passeges from Psalms, but I was already out of it. Near the end of his sermon, I started thinking. I guess God kind of dropped something onto me, and I realize why God seems to move when we worship.<br /><br />According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, worship is defined as "extravagant respect or admiration for or devotion to an object of esteem". It\'s like in Britian when the Queen walks in, everyone might kneel or show some sign of respect for her. People even refer to her as "Your Highness". I realized that when we worship, this is exactly what we do for the Lord. We put the Lord\'s status above our own, and give him praises for how good He is and everything He is. Whenever you enter a room where believers are praising and lifting up Jesus\' name, you can tell when the Lord\'s presense is manifested. You can tell that He is there.<br /><br />But it\'s all because we set our own status and our own ego aside for a moment to lift up the Lord. That\'s why it doesn\'t matter if you\'re on the worship team, if you\'re the one who wrote the lyrics to the powerful worship song, and it doesn\'t even matter if you are musically (or vocally) gifted. As long as you are lifting up the Lord over yourself, His presence can come and be manifested. In Romans 12:1, Paul says to "be a living sacrifice", and that "This is truly the way to worship Him". It doesn\'t say "sing with the voice of an angel - and this is truly acceptable worship", but it says about laying ourselves down, and putting ourselves aside.<br /><br />Even though I\'ve been told this and understand it, I still struggle with this. But from Adam and Eve, when humanity decided that we were going to elevate ourselves over what God says, we gave sin a foot in the door, and something that isn\'t God entered. But when we lay our lives down, we push that out the door, and let God enter in.<br /><br />I hope this encourages people, and I hope this post benefits us all (and pray that my mom doesn\'t get too mad for me being on my laptop when I shouldn\'t be).'], 14: ['Makeup', 'Monday, July 30, 2018', 'A common thing in the present times is for women to wear makeup. As a guy, I don\'t know or understand makeup, but I know that some people think they need it. Some people will see little faults in their skin or think they need a little extra help on their appearance to look good enough to go out in public.<br /><br />But spiritually, some people also think they need makeup. Some people see their own little faults abnd feel they need to cover them up before they can come before the Lord. I have two things to say on that.<br /><br />Matthew 11:28 says: "Then Jesus said, \'Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.\'"<br /><br />Jesus says here that when you come to Him with all your issues, He will give you rest. He doesn\'t say to mask your faults and you will find rest, but He says to be transparent, an to come to Him with your faults.<br /><br />Also, 2 Corinthians 13:4 says: "Although he was crucified in weakness, he now lives by the power of Go. We, too, are weak, just as Christ was, but when we deal with you we will be alive with him and and will have God\'s power."<br /><br />In ourselves, we are weak. But in Christ, we have power. This very statement shows that Christ is bigger than us in everything. So when we think we have a problem, when we look at it though Christ\'s perspective, that problem is so small that it might as well not exist.<br /><br />When you are being fed lies by the enemy, that you are not "Holy and blameless" (Colossians 1:22), look at your issues through the One who calls you Holy an blameless, who wipes clean all faults. And because of Him, you don\'t need any \'spiritual makeup\' to come before the Lord.']}
